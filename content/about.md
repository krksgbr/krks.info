I am a full stack web developer with a background in graphic design.

I can implement slick UIs using modern web frameworks such as **React** and **Elm**.

I can build backends using **NodeJS/Typescript/GraphQL/PostgresQL** and deploy them
using **Docker**.

I am increasingly interested in statically typed **functional programming**.

I am proficient in **Elm** and a newbie to **Haskell** and **nix**.

I spend too much of my free time configuring **Emacs**.

I like science fiction.

I am open to collaborations and commissions.
