[THESIS](https://thesisproject.us){target="__blank"} is a record label releasing experimental and electronic music. This project has been an ongoing collaboration with
[Gregory Euclide](https://www.instagram.com/gregory_euclide/?hl=en){target="__blank"} since 2016. I am responsible for the design, development and
maintenance of the webshop, and the related infrastructure. The site runs on a
custom ecommerce backend developed using MySQL/GraphQL (Prisma), Typescript and
NodeJS and is deployed to a DigitalOcean droplet using Docker. I recently
redesigned and re-implemented the frontend using Elm.
