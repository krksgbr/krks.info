The digital counterpart of the book *Under Pressure: Water and the City* by Arjan
van Timmeren and Laurence Henriquez. The site serves as an interactive
introduction to the topics explored in the book. It maps important locations
pertaining to excerpts from the book, that were annotated with geo-locations
and categories of topics. The bulk of the project was the development of custom
tooling and a content management system, that allowed 
the authors to annotate parts of the text with relevant geo-locations, topics
and markers. The annotated text snippets constitute the content for the website.
The frontend itself is a static site, developed with React and gatsby and is
deployed to Netlify. A simple ecommerce solution was also developed using
Snipcart and Mollie to allow the sale of the book through the website. I
co-designed the UI/UX together with [MÃ¡rton Kabai](http://www.martonkabai.com/){target="__blank"}. The project was sponsored by
[Amsterdam Insitute for Advance Metropolitan Solutions](https://www.ams-institute.org/){target="__blank"} and [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/){target="__blank"}.
